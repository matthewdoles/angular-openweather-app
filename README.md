# angular-openweather-app

## About
This AngularJS project is a weather app that uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/API/) to fetch and display up to date weather data. <br/>
This projects is directly forked from and inspired by Matthias Lienau's own [angular-openweather-app](https://github.com/atufkas/angular-openweather-app).

## Personal Demo
https://matthewdoles.github.io/angular-openweather-app/app/index.html#/forecast

## Personal Enhancements
* The ability to filter for location's weather by zip code
* An adpative Google Map that updates location based on search parameters ([ng-map](https://ngmap.github.io/))
* The ability to filter the number of forecasted days for a given location 
* Converted Celsius values to Fahrenheit
* Basic personal CSS style choices

## Personal Reasons
I used this project as a personal stepping stone to get into and learn basic AngularJS concpets such as directives, controllers, and services while digesting an open source API.
